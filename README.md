# Manure System for Farming Simulator 19 (GPS)
![For Farming Simulator 19](https://img.shields.io/badge/Farming%20Simulator-19-FF7C00.svg) [![Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/release/stijnwop/guidanceSteering.svg)](https://github.com/stijnwop/guidanceSteering/releases)

The Manure System mod changes the whole gameplay around handling your manure application. Experience what it really means to pump liquids as a real farmer.
Use the fill arms to actually be able to pump from open sources like: manure containers, lagoons and lakes. 
Use a specialized dockarm in order to suck from a docking funnel, or simply use a suction hose.
With a hose you are able to pump a liquid fill type from source to target. If applicable you could extend the liquid manure hose to reach larger ranges. 
Pumping does not always happen at full efficiency, manure thickness decreases the pump capacity and also the length of hoses affects your pump time. 


## Publishing
Only Wopster is allowed to publish any of this code as a mod to any mod site, or file sharing site. The code is open for your own use, but give credit where due. I will not accept support for any 'version' of the Manure System that is obtained from a sketchy mod page. Versioning is controlled by me and not by any other page. This confuses people and really holds back the development which results in no fun for me!

## Warning!
Please be aware that this is a ***DEVELOPMENT VERSION***!
* The development version can break the game or your savegame!
* The development version doesnÂ´t support the full feature package yet!

#### Multiplayer
This version should also work in Multiplayer.
